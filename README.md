# Hello, Welcome to my space race game

### This is my space race game I coded in lua using the framework love2d

This version of the game uses the version 0.10.2 of love2d you can download it here:

`Link: https://archive.org/details/love-0.10.2`

if this does not work you can try  using the current love2d version `Link: https://love2d.org/`

you can start the game by going into the src folder and typing

`love .` in the CLI or by drag and dropping the `src`folder on the love2d application logo
